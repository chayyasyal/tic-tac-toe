## Tech Test 3: Tic Tac Toe
Day 3 of the second tech test of week 10. I have two days to create a game of tic-tac-toe (aka noughts and crosses) for two players to play via web or the command line. For this task, I have decided to use Ruby.
Time limit: 1030 - 1600

## The brief

The rules of tic-tac-toe are as follows:

There are two players in the game (X and O)
Players take turns until the game is over
A player can claim a field if it is not already taken
A turn ends when a player claims a field
A player wins if they claim all the fields in a row, column or diagonal
A game is over if a player wins
A game is over when all fields are taken
Build the business logic for a game of tic tac toe. It should be easy to implement a working game of tic tac toe by combining code with any user interface, whether web or command line.

## Aims of task
1. To fully setup my environment and have three passing tests
2. To diagram everything effectively 
3. To work with confidence and refer back to my diagrams and Makers Academy pills for help

## Technologies used
1. Ruby
2. RSpec; testing framework
3. IRB

## Methodology used
1. Diagramming
2. TDD
3. Use of XP values
4. Domain Modelling 

## Day 1 Reflection on Task
I was very unsure as to what computer language I wanted to use for this task. I wanted to build on my current skills and confidence with Ruby that I had done with Gilded Rose.
In the end I decided to use Ruby and create a game of tic-tac-toe from the command line. It took me a while to set up the correct environment and decide how I wannted to structure my files, what sort of tests I wanted to do and what separate components of the actual game (such as board, grid, cell etc) would need to be reflected in my programme. 

## Day 1 Conclusion
I feel like that Day 1 has gone very well - especially after my initial nerves. I found that diagramming really helped me and gave me a very clear and visual idea of what I needed to include in my code, how everything was connected and what tests I needed to do in order to create the basic groundwork for my game.
So far I have 7 passing tests which include players (which returns both player names and what symbol they will be using in the game), board (and a grid for the board game) and cell (which allows a player to input an X or O into it). 

## Day 2 Reflection on Task
I felt that day two was significantly tougher than Day 1 because I had begun to try to implement a default number of rows, cells and grid structure for the board game. The latter proved to be easier said than done because I kept getting confused over the coordinates I needed to enter in order for the cells to know if an X or an O had been put inside of them. I found that my diagrams from the initial first draw helped, but, that I had to redo them or add new components (such as cells) in order for me to try and create code that was reflective of the game and my working process. 

## Day 2 Conclusion
At the end of Day 2 I have 11 passing tests which I was pleased with. If I had more time, I would have liked to have gone further in the task and produced a finished grid with elements/cells that could tell players if they were empty or not.
Overall, I really enjoyed this tech test and am happy that I managed to achieve what I have created using a computer language that I haven't been very confident using. 
The main aim of this week was to improve my use of Ruby and to not feel so daunted at the prospect of using. I am happy to say that I successfully achieved this goal.
